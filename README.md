# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This application is a work day scheduler to add items to the scheduler. The scheduler is color-coded for past, present, and future events. The work day scheduler can be edited by clicking on the box. The event can be saved into local storage with a save button as well. This website is an exercise in third party API's such as Bootstrap, jQuery, and Moment.js. This project helps keep track of a daily calendar.

When navigating to the page, the planner should display the current date. After scrolling down, the planner contains blocks of time in intervals of one hour each for a standard work day (9:00 AM to 5:00 PM). Time that has already passed is color-coded pink, the current hour is color-coded yellow, and future hours are color-coded blue-gray.
